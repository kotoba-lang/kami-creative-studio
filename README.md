# KAMI Creative Studio

KAMI Creative Studio is also the integrated video-and-music composer. It
authors `kami.media-project/v1`, a plain-EDN document that binds the canonical
`kami-eizo-timeline` video EDL to the canonical `kami-ongaku-project` DAW
session without copying either model.

```clojure
(require '[kami.creative-studio.media :as media])

(def production
  (media/project {:id "film-1"
                  :name "Opening"
                  :video eizo-timeline
                  :music ongaku-project
                  :assets asset-registry
                  :output {:width 1920 :height 1080 :fps 30}}))

(media/validate-project production)
(media/playhead production 60)        ; frame, SMPTE, seconds and music tick
(media/render-plan production "/tmp/render") ; pure ffmpeg command vectors
```

The binding deliberately preserves integer frames on the video side and
integer ticks on the music side. Seconds are derived for transport and sync
validation; a changing tempo map is never flattened by guessing. Asset ids
are resolved through `:media/assets`, and the render plan remains pure data —
the browser or fleet host owns file access and process execution. A complete
editable fixture lives at `resources/samples/media-project.edn`.

The Composer inspector and bottom V1/A1 lanes expose the unified document in
the existing single-window Studio. It includes frame seek, a real 30fps
transport, SMPTE/tick display, split-at-playhead, and pure move/trim/split
operations. Variable-tempo transport integrates every tempo segment in both
directions instead of assuming a constant BPM. The render planner distinguishes
still images from moving video, trims video at source time, normalizes stream
layout, concatenates picture and mixes the music master.

Current declared maturity: **逍遥 / production-authoring**. This means the
project can be authored, validated, transported and rendered end-to-end without
a mock execution boundary. It does not claim feature parity with Premiere or
Logic: waveform/thumbnail caching, pointer drag handles, multi-selection and
undo history remain ergonomic extensions over the working edit operations.

Open, credential-free creator UI for a CID-linked Murakumo pipeline:

```text
brief / reference
  → 3D model (TRELLIS / Hunyuan3D)
  → humanoid rig (UniRig / explicit heuristic)
  → motion (validated EDN clip on the Mac mini control fleet)
  → music (ACE-Step / Stable Audio)
  → kami.creative-project/v1 manifest
```

## What is live

- Responsive, accessible project workspace
- Realtime local/generated VRM and GLB preview with camera controls and animation playback
- Integrated `kotoba-lang/kisekae` character edit operations for parts, materials, expressions and motion
- Capability-authorized `kisekae` composition plans backed by real upstream VRM assets
- Release-generated real hair, face and outfit compositions with donor skins rebound to the base humanoid
- Independent CLJC trait-composition domain with one asset per slot and deterministic seeded randomization
- iPad-first single-window workspace: Library sidebar, Character Canvas, Inspector and Motion/Music Timeline in one viewport
- Murakumo progress polling and automatic preview when a generated artifact URL arrives
- Build-generated `KAMI Prism` sample project and embedded-buffer glTF, loaded into the viewer on startup
- Real VRM 1.0 humanoid display using pixiv's redistribution-permitted constraint sample, loaded from its upstream source URL
- Offline project planning and browser-local persistence
- JSON manifest preview, copy and download
- Explicit Murakumo endpoint submission with visible success/failure state
- No credentials, API keys, analytics or third-party scripts
- GitHub Pages deployment on every `main` update

Heavy model, rig and music inference requires a configured remote GPU capability. The Mac mini fleet controls the job graph and owns bounded EDN motion generation/validation; the UI never claims that CUDA-only models execute locally.

## Project contract

The generated document is `kami.creative-project/v1`. Every stage declares its modality, model, input relationship, output kinds and required execution capability. `noSilentFallback` is always true.

## Local development

```sh
npm ci
npm run release
python3 -m http.server 4173 --directory public
```

Verification:

```sh
clojure -M:test
# real ffmpeg + ffprobe; invoke through the workspace resource guard
clojure -M:e2e
```

Then open `http://localhost:4173`. The authored UI is ClojureScript Hiccup/Reagent. Styling is extracted from `shadow.css/css` forms; the GitHub Pages shell is generated from Hiccup during release. There are no hand-authored HTML or CSS files.

The sample source is `resources/samples/kami-sample.edn`. `npm run release` deterministically generates `public/samples/kami-sample.gltf` and its project manifest; generated files are not committed.

The real-character demo references pixiv's `VRM1_Constraint_Twist_Sample.vrm` directly from the `pixiv/three-vrm` repository. Its embedded VRM metadata permits redistribution and identifies pixiv Inc. as author; KAMI does not copy the binary into this repository.

During release, the worker-side CLJC compositor also fetches the official VRM Consortium Seed-san sample and generates three derived fixtures: Seed hair, face and outfit on the pixiv constraint-sample skeleton. The sources are parsed once, donor skins are rebound through `kotoba-lang/kisekae`, and the resulting VRM 1.0 files are deployment artifacts rather than committed binaries. Arbitrary multi-part combinations remain capability-gated Murakumo jobs; the UI reports that requirement instead of silently showing an unchanged avatar.

## Browser runtime boundary

- `kotoba-lang/webgpu` is the canonical browser GPU executor: CLJS calls the JavaScript WebGPU API directly (`navigator.gpu`, `requestAdapter`, `requestDevice`) and consumes EDN render-IR. It does not require Rust or Wasm.
- Kotoba Wasm remains the sandboxed guest-logic/capability layer. It can produce or transform scene intent, while the browser host executes rendering.
- This Studio currently uses `model-viewer` for portable glTF/VRM geometry preview. Direct `kami.webgpu` rendering is a separate opt-in renderer path, not falsely reported as active here.

## Workspace UX

The product is a single-window creative app rather than a sequence of web pages. Its information architecture follows Apple HIG patterns—persistent toolbar, sidebar, content canvas, inspector and bottom timeline—with 44px minimum primary controls. At the iPad landscape baseline (1024×768), the document has no page-level overflow; dense panels scroll internally without moving the canvas.

## Design reference

The asset-pack separation and point-and-click composition UX are independently designed with M3-org/CharacterStudio as a product reference. No CharacterStudio source code or assets are copied; KAMI's implementation is CLJC/CLJS Hiccup with shadow-css and its own manifest contract.
